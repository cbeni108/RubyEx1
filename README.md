Write a program that reads in a child's age and then prints the string "Are we there yet?" once for each year of the child's age.
Santa needs to know who's been naughty and who's been nice.  Create a hash with name as the key and either 'naughty' or 'nice' as the value. Populate the hash with at least three items.  Display the key, value pairs on the screen.  Allow Santa to input another name and to specify whether that person was naughty or nice.  Add the entry to the hash.  Allow Santa to enter a name and display whether that person was naughty or nice.
Write a program that randomly determines whether you passed or failed the exam.  To do this, write a method that generates a random value and, based on this value,  return true or false from the method.  The statement to generate a random value looks like this:
num = Random.rand(2)
Call the method three times and print out the result.
